if we have the Ha and Hb, you can get balmer decrement, then you can use Calzetti curve to get A_v. With A_v you can use Calzetti + Salmon+ 16 UV-blue power law extension to get dust corrected OII (or anything below 0.5 um)

if we don't have Ha and Hb, we can use Av maps from Alex or A(Ha) maps from Erica Nelson+ 16, Wang+ 16, or A_V(r) from Tachella+ 18 with careful attention to mass (Tacchella only for > 10^10.)
